# Vector Arrows
This library is the attempt, to define Arrows that use Vectors as their
primary data Structure (instead of Tuple). 

On the one hand, there are tuples, that are of a static length but can
hold different types of data. On the other hand there are vectors, which
are more dynamic in length, but pretty static concerning their data's 
type. Nonetheless for hardware design this behavior is appreciated.
